<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project aims to simulate a scenario where an online store wants to test the capability of inserting 1000 records into its order management system using two concurrency control techniques: PESSIMISTIC LOCK and OPTIMISTIC LOCK.

* **Insertion with Pessimistic Lock**: This functionality simulates the insertion of 1000 records into the store's database using the Pessimistic Lock technique. Pessimistic Lock ensures that, during the insertion operation, the affected records are locked against modifications by other processes.
* **Insertion with Optimistic Lock**: This functionality performs an insertion without explicit record locking. Instead, it uses the Optimistic Lock technique, which checks if there have been any modifications to the records since they were read until the moment they are updated. If there is concurrent modification, the update operation is cancelled.

### Built With

The project was built using a combination of technologies and frameworks. It primarily leverages Java for its core programming language. The Spring Framework was employed to facilitate various aspects of application development, including dependency injection, transaction management, and web application setup. JPA (Java Persistence API) and Hibernate were used for object-relational mapping, allowing seamless interaction with the underlying database.

For database management, an H2 Database was chosen, providing an efficient and lightweight solution for development and testing purposes. Flyway was utilized for database migration management, ensuring a structured and consistent database schema across different environments.

Additionally, the project integrated Apache HttpComponents to perform insertions within the API itself. This was achieved through a Client class, which made POST requests to the API, enabling the addition of data in a programmatic and automated manner. This integration was pivotal for the insertion functionality, providing an effective and controlled means of adding new records directly to the application.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This project uses the Maven system for dependency management and compilation. Follow the steps below to run the application locally:

#### Prerequisites

- Make sure you have Maven installed on your system. If you don't, you can download and install it from the [official Maven website](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

#### Installation

1. Clone the repository.:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:EduardoMarcal-347/pedidos-multithread-locking-strategies.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project desired directory.:

    ```bash
    cd pessimistic-lock-api
    ```
    or
    ```bash
    cd optimistic-lock-api
    ```
    
#### Running the application

1. In the project directory, navigate to the class `PedidosApplication.java`

2. Run the application. This will start the api.

#### Running the Client 

1. In the api directory, navigate to the folder clientRequests, and you will find the class `Client.java`

2. Run the application. This will start the client post requests.

Remember to configure the necessary information, such as the desired range to generate the random number in the request if you want to customize the specific outputs of your project, as indicated in the comments of the source code.

With these steps, you will be ready to use the application locally. If you encounter any issues or have any questions, feel free to reach out.
